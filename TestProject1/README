#PulseMobile Demo

Current functionality is limited to switching between 
"completed" and "ongoing" surveys, all hardcoded in.

One current bug is the inability to select the image to use
based on props, since React Native does not allow dynamic
image sourcing. I spent several hours attempting to solve 
this issue and was unsuccessful.
